Whenever raffle is created a new `topic` is generated.

The benefit will be in for people interested in this raffle to be subscribing to this topic, would get to know about people entering the raffle. It will also help to make frontend of the project easier to integrate

It would be a public topic 

In smart contract when creating the raffle, create a topic before in the frontend and subscribe, then pass the topicid in the function argument. I guess we may need a mapping as well

Whenever any person enters the raffle they will send a message which would be much cheaper (Basically transaction cost less than a cent)

### We may now start frontend!
